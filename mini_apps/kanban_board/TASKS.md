# 📋 Project: Mini-Kanban Board
**Goal:** A lightweight, self-hosted Kanban board for managing personal tasks.

## 🧠 Feature Ideas (Brainstorming)
*   **Drag & Drop Interface:** Move cards between columns (To Do -> Doing -> Done).
*   **Local Storage:** Save data in the browser (so no complex database setup needed initially).
*   **FastAPI Backend:** (Optional) To save tasks to a JSON file on the VPS permanently.
*   **Dark Mode:** Because we are developers. 😎
*   **Tags/Labels:** "Urgent", "Bug", "Idea".

## 📝 TODO List (Implementation Plan)

### Phase 1: The UI (Frontend)
- [ ] **Structure:** Create `index.html` with 3 columns (To Do, Doing, Done).
- [ ] **Styling:** Create `style.css` (Clean, modern look).
- [ ] **Logic:** Create `script.js` to handle adding tasks and moving them.
- [ ] **Persistence:** Save tasks to `localStorage` (so they survive refresh).

### Phase 2: Feature Upgrades (Fun & Sync)
- [ ] **Confetti Effect:** Add "canvas-confetti" library to trigger celebration when task is moved to Done. 🎊
- [ ] **Backend Integration:** (Pending) Sync tasks to server.

### Phase 3: Deployment
- [ ] Test on VPS port 8000.
- [ ] Push to GitHub.
